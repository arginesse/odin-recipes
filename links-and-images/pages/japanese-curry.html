    <a href="https://housefoods-group.com/products/en/recipe/vmt_s.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got most of this recipe from here</a>
    <p>painfully easy and painfully delicious. have a glass of water on hand, not because it's spicy but because of its sodium content</p>
    <p>my favorite brand is vermont curry so i'd recommend using that! you can add meat if you'd like but i personally don't like it in this dish</p>
