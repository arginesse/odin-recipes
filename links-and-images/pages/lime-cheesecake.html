    <p>i've made a couple adjustments to the recipe. in my experience it's a small improvement</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely ground graham crackers (from 9 crackers)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh Key lime juice, plus 2 teaspoons grated zest (from 16 limes), and thinly sliced lime rounds for serving</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup cold heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Stir in butter until mixture resembles wet sand and holds together when squeezed.</li>
        <li>Press crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>Freeze until firm, 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and condensed milk on medium-high speed and stop just before it gets fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add lime juice, zest, and vanilla. Beat 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip cream to stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Gently fold into cream-cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over chilled crust; smooth top with an offset spatula. Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 12 hours and up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>Run a knife along cake's edge before releasing sides of pan, then under bottom to loosen. Serve, garnished with lime rounds.</li>
    </ol>
